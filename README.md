# data-driven-car-following
Development of parametric, deep learning, and reinforcement learning agent-based model of car-following behaviour. The models aim to be data-driven, and take into account the heterogeneity of drivers' behaviour and vehicle types. Potential future applications include investigation of a mixed traffic of human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles.
